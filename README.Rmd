This repository contains models from the project "Improving Patient flow 
between Acute, Community and Social care (IPACS)", converted into a package
format. These are models used for D2A resource planning.  

**How does this repository differ from other repositories?**
This repository is based on [IPACS_MODEL](https://github.com/AliHarp/IPACS_MODEL) which contains the IPACS model with re-coding, comments, bug identification and bug fixes by [Amy Heather](https://github.com/amyheather). In this repository, the model is then converted into package format by [Amy Heather](https://github.com/amyheather).



## Installation

You can install the development version of ipacs from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
